%% @doc This function is called whenever an application is started using
%% application:start/1,2, and should start the processes of the
%% application. If the application is structured according to the OTP
%% design principles as a supervision tree, this means starting the top
%% supervisor of the tree.
%% @end

-spec stop(State::term()) -> ok.
%% @doc This function is called whenever an application has stopped. It is
%% intended to be the opposite of Module:start/2 and should do any
%% necessary cleaning up.
